# Human-Wellbeing-and-Machine-Learning
In this repository, there are the scripts necessary to obtain the results in "Human and Wellbeing and Machine Learning". The scripts have been written in collaboration with Caspar Kaiser and Ekaterina Oparina. 

While the paper is already available on Arxiv - https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00574 - we are currently reviewing and updating it, and a final different version
will be published in some journal (the finally published version of the paper may even have a different title). Nonetheless, the codes have not changed since the Arxiv publication.   

In particular, those available here are specific for the results derived from the SOEP dataset. 

The operations of data creation, cleaning, engineering and wrangling are performed in different scripts from those where Machine Learning algorithms are fit. All codes are heavily commented also to favor readability to people not familiar with Python and R.
