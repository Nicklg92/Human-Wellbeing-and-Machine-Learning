# Human-Wellbeing-and-Machine-Learning
This repository contains replication codes for ‘Human Wellbeing and Machine Learning’ by Ekaterina Oparina* (r) Caspar Kaiser* (r) Niccolò Gentile*; Alexandre Tkatchenko, Andrew E. Clark, Jan-Emmanuel De Neve and Conchita D'Ambrosio (* equal first authors in random order). The latest version of the paper is available on Arxiv - https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00574. 

Also, as a Working Paper here: https://wellbeing.hmc.ox.ac.uk/article/wp-2301-machine-learning-in-the-prediction-of-human-wellbeing

The scripts allow replicating the results of the paper for the German Socio-Economic Panel dataset which is available from https://paneldata.org/. The codes include R and Python files for data preparation and Machine Learning estimation. The Machine Learning estimation approaches are identical for the other two datasets that are used in the paper. The description of Machine Learning algorithms and the computation details can be found in the paper. All codes are heavily commented to favour readability to people less familiar with Python and R.

For the results of this paper, the codes were run using Python 3.9.5 (default, May 18 2021, 14:42:02) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] Windows Version 20h2 (OS build 19042). The computer was equipped with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10610U CPU @ 1.80GHz 2.30 GHz and 16.0 GB of RAM, of which 15.6 usable, System Type 64-but. Note that the results could be different yet would remain very similar if the user runs the codes on a different computing environment.
